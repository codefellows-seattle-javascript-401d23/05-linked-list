these files contain instructions for linked lists. 
to make a linked list, use the insertAtHead or insertAtEnd methods.
These methods take a value and insert it into a linked list, or create a list if none exists. 

to remove values, use the pop() or remove() methods. The pop method removes the last entry in the list.
The remove() method takes in a value and removes all entries containing that value from the list. 

The map() method takes in a function and applies that function to every entry in the linked list.
