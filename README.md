# Linked List
**Author**: Lacy Hogan
**Version**: 1.0.0 
## Overview
This application creates a constructor, LinkedList, which allows you to create a instances of a linked list of nodes. It contains 5 methods. You can insert a node at the head of the list, insert a node at the end of the list, find a node in the list, remove the last node (pop), and create a copy of the list and modify it (map). There are three tests for each method to test different lengths and different modifications.
