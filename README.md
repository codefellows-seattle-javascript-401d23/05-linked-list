####  Documentation  

This lab is unfinished because I have done what I can without assistance. I will find a TA for help tomorrow.

## Data Structures
  Using the src file which holds __test__ and lib. Lib holds my js and test holds my js testing. All packages and dependencies are in the tree outside of these folders but within the lab. 
 I'm not sure what I'm to do with the following:
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests

    ## Credits
    Vinicio and his starter code and Sarah B for sending a youtube video which helped to further explain Vinicio's starter code. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA
